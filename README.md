# Covid-19-in-india-dashboard-using-Tableau
In this dashboard we have used 6 CSVB files and one India map shape file.
Dual axis line chart and pie chart to show age group details and covid cases by state. Here we also created a calculated field in string for Title of dashbord.
Different horizontal bar charts are also included in it. 
Hence the dashboard is created on tiled format and state wise filter is also added for the dual axis line chart.
